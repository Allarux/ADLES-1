## [1.4.3] - 2018-01-28
### Added
- Dependency on [argopt](https://github.com/casperdcl/argopt)

### Changed
- Behind the scenes changes to commandline argument parsing.
Parsing now generates argparse.Namespace objects using argopt library.
This makes argparse features available to use, and enables us to use
libraries such as argcomplete and Gooey that rely on argparse.

### Added
- This CHANGELOG!.
- Python 2 compatiblity warnings.

and will instead log an ERROR.


## [1.4.0] - 2017-12-19
### Removed
- Python 2.7 support.
- Python 2 tests.

### Changed

## [1.3.6] - 2017-12-19
### Fixed
- Fixed issue with any of the commandline scripts where just entering
 the script name (e.g "adles") on the commandline would error,
 instead of printing help as a user would expect.
